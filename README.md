# ScoutingServer2019

ScoutingServer2019 is based off of the [server-2018](https://github.com/frc1678/server-2018) and [Scout-Manager-2018](https://github.com/frc1678/Scout-Manager-2018) repositories created by the Citrus Circuits, FRC 1678. It utilizes Firebase for data storage, and a QR code system for data transfer between the scouting tablets and the server.
